#Instructions
In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. You should

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.

2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

3.Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

In point 3, focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials.

As a motivating example, compare the distribution of 1000 random uniforms

```{R}
hist(runif(1000)) #uniform distribution
```

and the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 random uniforms

```{R}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(runif(40)))
hist(mns)
```

This distribution looks far more Gaussian than the original uniform distribution!

This exercise is asking you to use your knowledge of the theory given in class to relate the two distributions.

Confused? Try re-watching video lecture 07 for a starter on how to complete this project.

```{R}
#Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations
lambda <- 0.2

#You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note #that you will need to do a thousand simulations.
n.exp <- 40
n.sim <- 1000

#The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation #is also 1/lambda.

mean.dist.exp <- 1/lambda
sd.dist.exp <- 1/lambda

```

```{R}

#The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) #where lambda is the rate parameter.

dist.exp <- rexp(n.exp,lambda)

#The sample mean is 
mean(dist.exp) #5 expect 1/lambda

#The sd is
sd(dist.exp) #5 expected

#and the distribution looks like

hist(dist.exp)


#its a skewed right histogram! Expected
```

```{R}
#Now lets do it 1000 times and take the mean.
mean.dist.exp = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mean.dist.exp = c(mean.dist.exp,
                                      mean(rexp(n.exp,lambda)))

hist(mean.dist.exp)

mean(mean.dist.exp) #5 expected
sd(mean.dist.exp) #5 expected

```

```{R}
#1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the #distribution.

#The mean is 
mean(mean.dist.exp)

#And the difference between it and the theoretical mean is
mean(mean.dist.exp)- (1/lambda)
```


```{R}
#2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

#The variance is 
var(mean.dist.exp)

#The difference between the theoretical variance and sample variance is

var(mean.dist.exp) - (sd.dist.exp^2/n.exp) 

```

```{R}
#3.Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
collection.dist.exp = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) collection.dist.exp = c(collection.dist.exp,
                                      rexp(n.exp,lambda))

mean(collection.dist.exp)
sd(collection.dist.exp)

hist(collection.dist.exp)


#By usin qqnorm we can test if the distribution is normal
#We expect normal distributions to have a linear slope
qqnorm(collection.dist.exp)
qqnorm(mean.dist.exp)

#Here we see that the mean of exp functions is normal and the collection of exp functions is not normal

#This is because of the central limit theorem.
```
